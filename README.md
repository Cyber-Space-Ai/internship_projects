It is important to install the required dependencies to run the program.

First,we need to install node.js in your  pcüíª 

 /*Open your Node.js project in a command-line interface or terminal.*/
 

Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command      
npm init


Install the required packages:

Use the npm package manager to install the MongoDB driver by running the following command       
npm install mongodb

 we need to include a few packages for our Nodejs application              
 npm install express --save

Express allows us to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests         
npm install body-parser --save

If you want to read HTTP POST data , you have to use the ‚Äúbody-parser‚Äù node module         
npm install mongoose --save
          
          npm install multer

Start the MongoDB. Run app.js file                :node app.js
